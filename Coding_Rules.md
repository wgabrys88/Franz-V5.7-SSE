Coding Rules:

- Python 3.13 only. Modern syntax, strict typing with dataclasses and pattern matching. No legacy code, no compatibility shims.
- Windows 11 only. No cross-platform fallbacks or compatibility layers.
- Latest Google Chrome browser support only.
- OpenAI-compatible /chat/completions API is used by design (stateless).
- Maximum code reduction. Remove every possible line while keeping 100% original functionality.
- Perfect Pylance/pyright compatibility: full type hints, frozen dataclasses for all configuration.
- No comments anywhere in any file. Code blocks must contain no non-ASCII characters.
- No slicing or truncating of data anywhere in the code. Python code must not impact the data in any way, not even as a safety mechanism.
- No functional "magic values" - all constants must live in frozen dataclasses.
- No duplicate flows.
- No hidden fallback behavior unless explicitly approved.
- .html files must use latest HTML5 + modern CSS (custom properties, grid/flex) + modern JS. All HTML files must follow the dark cyber aesthetic and be independent in terms of the "dark theme" from the device or the operating system that will be used to view them. All HTML files are meant to be displayed in latest Google Chrome on 1080p 16:9 ratio screen. Ensure that .html files are going to be modern without any legacy support - similar code rules to python, minimalism (code reduction) and modern design only.
- If asked for README.md file creation, generate also comprehensive MERMAID independent "dark theme" diagram containing all the connections inside the system and outside, their directions and other details. README.md including the diagram must be properly decoded by github.com without any issue.
- Optimize every prompt for the small 0.8B–2B Qwen3.5 VL model: short, explicit, format-enforcing, minimal chain-of-thought.
- Write prompts in form of three quote (docstring) type of comments, do not make a multiline prompt created as independent strings with end of the line characters at the end - its very hard to maintain that way)
- Ensure the code contains no duplications and no dead functionality. Remove any functional fallbacks.
